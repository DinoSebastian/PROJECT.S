You are now a part of the DevOps team in Logicworkscompany,which is a leading AWSconsulting and Managed Services Provider with 25 years of experience inenterprise IT. Your first project is to replicate the current environment on AWS as per the following requirements:

1.Adoption of IAC (Infrastructure as Code) to facilitate faster replication of environments for different customers who may have a need for similar environments.

2.Infrastructure must include multi-region architecture and needs to run in two different regions for High Availability and Disaster Recovery purposes.(Hint: ensure proper networking system)

3.The applications should be run in a containerto prevent errors and inconsistencies. The container images  are supposed to be storedin a docker image repository. Additionally, a container management system has to be implemented to manage growth in the number of containers in the future.

4.Manual CI/CD pipeline deployments did not fulfill the requirements. Hence there is a need to automate the CI/CD pipeline.The CI/CD pipeline should include source, build, stage, manual approval and production environment.

5.The application will be running in two different regions, so the source code repository needs to be replicated inthe otherregion as well, in order to pull the code locally within the regionsand avoid any latency issues.

6.The infrastructure and the application need to be undercontinuousmonitoringwith notification mechanism.

7.It is necessary to have an approved CI/CD pipeline before the code gets pushed to production.


SOLUTION 


1. Adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Utilize AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) to define your infrastructure as code. This enables fast and consistent replication of environments for different customers. Use templates to define and provision resources, ensuring easy reproducibility.

2. Multi-Region Architecture: Implement a multi-region architecture for high availability and disaster recovery. Utilize AWS services such as Amazon VPC, Elastic Load Balancing, and Route 53 to establish connectivity and distribute traffic across regions. Configure proper networking systems, including VPC peering or VPN connections, to ensure seamless communication.

3. Containerization with Docker: Containerize your applications using Docker. Store container images in a Docker image repository such as Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry). Implement a container management system like Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) or Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) to manage container deployment, scaling, and orchestration.

4. Automated CI/CD Pipeline: Implement an automated CI/CD pipeline using AWS services like AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy. Configure the pipeline to include source code integration, automated builds, testing, staging environment deployment, manual approval, and production environment deployment. Ensure that the pipeline is triggered automatically upon code changes and follows the approved process.

5. Replication of Source Code Repository: Replicate the source code repository in both regions to ensure local access and avoid latency issues. Consider using distributed version control systems like Git and hosting platforms like GitHub or AWS CodeCommit. Implement replication mechanisms to keep code repositories synchronized across regions.

6. Continuous Monitoring and Notification: Utilize AWS services like Amazon CloudWatch to monitor infrastructure and application performance. Configure relevant metrics, alarms, and notifications to proactively identify and address any issues. Implement log aggregation using services like AWS CloudWatch Logs or ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for comprehensive log analysis.

7. Approved CI/CD Pipeline: Establish a defined process for code promotion to the production environment. Ensure that code changes undergo rigorous testing, security scans, and quality assurance. The CI/CD pipeline should have manual approval stages where designated approvers review and approve the changes before they are deployed to the production environment.
